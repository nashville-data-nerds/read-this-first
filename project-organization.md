# Project Organization

Each project will be organized within different repositories.  Before work on a project can be started, an initial Analysis Plan must be written up that covers the following:

1. *What is the purpose of the analysis?*  This should highlight why an analysis will be helpful to the non-profit organization.  
2. *What are some specific questions that a non-profit is hoping to have answered?*  Based on the purpose of the analysis, this section should flesh out some specific questions the non-profit is hoping to have answered from this analysis.
3. *What data sources will be used in this analysis?* Will this analysis be done using only publicly available data or will data need to be supplied by the non-profit?
4. *What are the expected deliverables?* After the analysis or analyses are completed, what is the non-profit expecting as an end product.  This could be a dashboard or a series of data visualizations that will be used in marketing material.
